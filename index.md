Hi, my name’s Max! I’m a doctoral researcher at the University of Oldenburg’s Department of Philosophy and a research associate at the research group “Need-Based Justice and Distribution Procedures” (FOR 2104) of the German Research Foundation (DFG), where I am concerned with questions of distributive justice between normative theory and empirical social research, focussing especially on need-based distributive justice.
